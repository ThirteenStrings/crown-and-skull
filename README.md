# Crown and Skull TTRPG System for Foundry VTT

## What is Crown and Skull?

Welcome to CROWN and SKULL Volume I, a new RPG system and setting from Runehammer. Core rules, dice-driven enemy tactics, comprehensive GM tools, 40 original monsters, a massive traversable world, and huge loot tables await you in these pages. This book is thick with story, and puts the player at the controls. For game masters, a convention-breaking set of resources and techniques to go into the unknown WITH your players. No stats, no HP, no telling what may unfold...

The rules system in CROWN and SKULL will prove a significant departure from the mechanics and methods that have seen such meteoric growth in recent years. As such, settle in for a brain-tickling ride into new frontiers. If you feel challenged by the player-focused aspects of this book, the prep-free GM style... that means youâ€™re in the sweet spot. 

Which will you choose? The crown, or the skull?
