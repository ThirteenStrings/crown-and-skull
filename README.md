# Crown and Skull TTRPG System for Foundry VTT

## What is Crown and Skull?

Welcome to CROWN and SKULL Volume I, a new RPG system and setting from Runehammer. Core rules, dice-driven enemy tactics, comprehensive GM tools, 40 original monsters, a massive traversable world, and huge loot tables await you in these pages. This book is thick with story, and puts the player at the controls. For game masters, a convention-breaking set of resources and techniques to go into the unknown WITH your players. No stats, no HP, no telling what may unfold...

The rules system in CROWN and SKULL will prove a significant departure from the mechanics and methods that have seen such meteoric growth in recent years. As such, settle in for a brain-tickling ride into new frontiers. If you feel challenged by the player-focused aspects of this book, the prep-free GM style... that means youâ€™re in the sweet spot. 

Which will you choose? The crown, or the skull?

### Adding Items
Most of the functionality of the sheet comes from dragging and dropping items. Be sure to import the compendiums for player's guide items and starter actors. Many sections of the sheet are hidden until appropriate items are added in order to reduce visual clutter.

### Combat Phase Selection
When beginning a new combat, players will press the "Phase Selection" button on their character sheet to choose their phase. GMs can push enemy combatants into the turn tracker via the button on enemy character sheets.

### Tracking Hero Points
The top left of the sheet has four boxes to aid in tracking hero points.

**Curr** The number of hero points currently tracked on the sheet. This is a combination of the cost of all equipment, skills, abilities, advancements, spells, and companions. It is automatically tracked through the items that are dragged and dropped onto the sheet.

**Max** The total number of hero points the character has had available. This starts at 50. It is increased by rewards and flaws. GMs should create Reward Items for players to drag and drop to represent hero points awarded for deeds and treasure hoards.

**Remaining** How many hero points the player has remaining to spend on advancements and equipment.

**Lost** This is the only editable box. Whenever a player deletes an item from their sheet, due to the item being destroyed or a consumable being used up, the cost of that item should be added (manually) to the box. This amount is subtracted the remaining hero points to account for those permanently lost hero points.
